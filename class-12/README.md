# Class 12: Adding A Chart to the Vote Tracker App

## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing Lecture 12 of Code 201, students will:

- Demonstrate understanding of how the `<canvas>` element can be used, as demonstrated by observations of the instructional staff during class discussion and a quiz administered through Canvas.
- Demonstrate the ability to read documentation to utilize a JavaScript library, as demonstrated by successful completion of the daily code assignment.

## Feedback

- Partner Power Hour would be nice. 
- I learned a lot during demo code, code alongs, and code review sections and was able to apply the lessons to my labs.
- the debugging exercise was  good too. We got plenty of ambiguity and not a lot of information to solve/fix problems. 

- This past week was not so bad. I feel like it's been the least stressful so far, still kind of trying to make sense of all that we've learned. 
- This week seem rather easy and review of what we've been doing.
- Challenging, but in a good way.
- I don't have much to code on Mondays.
- Just need more time.
- This course has been challenging and I'm definitely out of my comfort zone but as I continue to push I'm realizing that I'm retaining the information for the most part

- Some suggestions I have are maybe considering remote learning or a curriculum based more for strictly online.
- it would be cool to have  monitors to hookup to in the lab area.
- What happened to the big jar of mints at the front??
- When asking a question to class please restate and summarize the question, or the goal of the question. A few times in class today I was thinking and missed the premise. Like for example we were talking about how to ensure star wars images don't repeat in the demo code, and I thinking do you mean from click to click or never repeat at all after multiple clicks but didn't raise my hand to clarify.
